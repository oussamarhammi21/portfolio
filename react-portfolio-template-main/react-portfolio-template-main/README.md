- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **NextUI**: A React UI library for building modern web applications.
- **React Router**: A library for routing in React applications.
- **Recharts**: A charting library for React.

- **Three Globe**: A library for creating interactive globes with Three.js.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **Framer Motion**: A library for animations in React.
- **Lucide React**: A library of icons for React.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code.
- **Prettier**: A code formatter for maintaining consistent code style.

## Getting Started

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint Configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ["./tsconfig.node.json", "./tsconfig.app.json"],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
});
```
